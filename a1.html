        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
            <p class="lead mb-4">Artificial intelligence has made huge strides in recent years, and the tech doesn’t seem to be slowing down! New uses for this type of technology are being discovered every day, and many have become commonplace in everyday life. From smart cars to online search engines, AI has infiltrated nearly every aspect of our lives, making previously time-consuming tasks simpler than ever before. And with more and more businesses adopting artificial intelligence into their products, the technology’s popularity shows no signs of slowing down in the future. Here’s how artificial intelligence is changing everyday life!

            <h3>From self-driving cars to smart homes</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4">It’s easy to think of artificial intelligence as something futuristic and very much in development. In reality, it’s already shaping our everyday lives in several different ways. In fact, with products like Amazon Alexa and smart thermostats, it could be argued that AI already plays an important role in some parts of most people’s lives. And, thanks to an emerging industry surrounding deep learning—one that involves a lot less hype than what you might see on Facebook or Google—artificial intelligence is poised to make even more noise in the future. From smarter phones to more effective healthcare options, we take a look at how technology powered by AI might shape our future</p>

            <h3>Even in healthcare, AI will be a game changer</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4">By collecting and learning from detailed medical records, AI can predict disease outbreaks, support diagnostics, and suggest treatment plans. For example, IBM’s Watson supercomputer crunches data and spits out diagnoses for patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. In health care, there are some things only human doctors and nurses can do—making ethical decisions based on a patient’s case history, for example—but AI will fill gaps in knowledge as well as labor shortages.</p>

            <h3>When will you see AI everywhere?</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4">It’s already here. Artificial intelligence has permeated our culture; it’s just that not everyone has realized how much it affects us every day. To get a better idea of how AI will be part of our lives in years to come, take a look at what’s happening today. Our world has been forever changed by AI, in both small and big ways! Most people don’t realize it yet, but we are currently living in an era that resembles science fiction.</p>

            <h3>The world will change in ways we cannot even imagine</h3>
            <p class="lead mb-4">Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems capable of carrying out tasks normally associated with human beings. Some robots are designed to perform physical tasks, such as manufacturing or construction work, while others are meant to perform more complex tasks, such as image recognition. If a computer can be said to think at all, then it is an AI system. The more AI systems develop, however, greater influence they will have on our lives. From performing medical diagnoses and forecasting real estate prices to driving cars and controlling guns in war zones—technology will soon become an integral part of people's lives. How we use it may determine whether technology improves society or threatens humanity itself. It’s worth considering how we can control technology instead of letting it control us!</p>
